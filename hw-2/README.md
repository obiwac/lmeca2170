## How it works

The project uses WebGL 2. Wich is vanilla.

### Half-edge data structure (part 1)
Here is the following structure:\
mesh.nodes: an array of nodes\
[-] node.id: a unique integer identifying the node (use the indices given in the JSON file).\
[-] node.pos: a pair of coordinates representing the position of the node.
mesh.faces: an array of faces\
[-] face.id: a unique integer identifying the face.\
[-] face.incidentEdge: one (!) edge that is incident to face.\
mesh.edges: an array of (half-)edges; an edge has structure\
[-] edge.orig: the origin node of the half-edge.\
[-] edge.dest: the destination node of the half-edge.\
[-] edge.incidentFace: the face to the left of the half-edge.\
[-] edge.next: the next half-edge on the boundary of the incident face.\
[-] edge.oppo: the opposite half-edge.\
### Point location (part 2)
There is a function called `marching_triangle` wich takes 3 arguments, for point locations you can pass `undefined` to origin and if you want to vizualise the triangle you have to pass true to `find_triangle`. for eg.
```
marching_triangle([0.11404410041538215, 0.931412313029647], undefined, true)
```

### Intersection segment-mesh (part 3)
It is the same as part 2, except you need to pass the `origin` argument which is the second point of the segment.
