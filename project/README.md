# Delaunay triangulation and voronoi diagram

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the LMECA2170 course at UCLouvain. The goal was to implement Delaunay triangulation using Voronoi diagrams. Delaunay triangulation is a fundamental concept in computational geometry, and it is widely used in various applications, such as mesh generation, computer graphics, and finite element analysis

## Requirements
We highly recommand to enable hardware-acceleration in your browser to fully benefit GPU rendering.

## Getting Started
You have to launch a web server in python to be able to view the webise.
```code
	python3 -m http.server [Port]
```
Then  can connect to the website at `http://0.0.0.0:Port/`
